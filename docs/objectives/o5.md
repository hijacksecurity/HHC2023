    Hey, Sparkle Redberry here! So, I've been trying to learn about Azure and the Azure CLI and it's driving me nuts.<br/>
    Alabaster Snowball decided to use Azure to host some of his fancy new IT stuff on Geese Islands, and now us elves have to learn it too.<br/>
    Anyway, I know it's important and everyone says it's not as difficult as it seems, but honestly it still feels like quite a challenge for me.<br/>
    Alabaster sent us this Azure CLI reference as well. It's super handy, he said. Honestly, it just confuses me even more.<br/>
    If you can spare a moment, would you mind giving me a hand with this terminal? I'd be really grateful! Pretty please, with holly leaves on top!<br/>


## Hints

??? tip "Azure CLI Reference"
    <i>From: Sparkle Redberry<br/>
    Terminal: Azure 101</i><br/>
    The Azure CLI tools come with a builtin help system, but Microsoft also provides this [handy cheatsheet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest).

    
## Solution

This challenge is all about getting familiar with [Azure's az CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest) and doing a lil' recon on Geese Islands' IT infrastructure. ðŸ˜‰

### Question 1
!!! question "Question"
    You may not know this but the Azure cli help messages are very easy to access. First, try typing:<br/>
    $ az help | less

It's nice to know `help` is always available in addition to documentation.

![help](../img/objectives/o5/help.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    az help | less


### Question 2
!!! question "Question"
    Next, you've already been configured with credentials. Use 'az' and your 'account' to 'show' your current details and make sure to pipe to less ( | less )

The [az account show](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-account-show) gets the details of a subscription.
Important to note here, the account is part of Azure Cloud and its name is "northpole-sub".

![account](../img/objectives/o5/account.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    az account show | less
    

### Question 3
!!! question "Question"
    Excellent! Now get a list of resource groups in Azure.<br/>
    For more information:<br/>
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest<br/>

The [az group list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az-group-list) lists resource groups.
Notable here is that this account has 2 resource groups: "northpole-rg1" and "northpole-rg2".
ChatGPT is helpful for gentle introduction to Azure's terminology, should it be needed.

![ChatGPT Groups](../img/objectives/o5/chatgpt_groups.jpg)

![groups](../img/objectives/o5/groups.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    az group list | less


### Question 4
!!! question "Question"
    Ok, now use one of the resource groups to get a list of function apps. For more information:<br/>
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp?view=azure-cli-latest<br/>
    Note: Some of the information returned from this command relates to other cloud assets used by Santa and his elves.<br/>

The [az functionapp list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-functionapp-list) lists function apps and requires you to pass a resource group as a parameter for this question.
If you are more familiar working with AWS, ChatGPT can make a simple comparison to Azure's terminology. 
Interesting finding here is that there are no function apps in northpole-rg2 resource group but northpole-rg1 contains one with hostname "northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net" and interesting tags
of "/api/create-cert?code=candy-cane-twirl" and "northpole-ssh-certs". It is of type "Microsoft.Web/sites", so a web app and it's currently running.

![ChatGPT Functionapp](../img/objectives/o5/chatgpt_functionapp.jpg)

![functionapp](../img/objectives/o5/functionapp.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    az functionapp list --resource-group northpole-rg1 | less


### Question 5
!!! question "Question"
    Find a way to list the only VM in one of the resource groups you have access to.<br/>
    For more information:<br/>
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest<br/>

The [az vm list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest#az-vm-list) lists details of virtual machines. It also requires a resource group to be passed as a parameter for this question.
In our case, the infrastructure is starting to make sense - while northpole-rg1 resource group contains the function app, northpole-rg2 has the VM.
Notable aspects of the VM is that it's Ubuntu Server 16.04 and named "NP-VM1".

![vm](../img/objectives/o5/vm.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    az vm list --resource-group northpole-rg2



### Question 6
!!! question "Question"
    Find a way to invoke a run-command against the only Virtual Machine (VM) so you can RunShellScript and get a directory listing to reveal a file on the Azure VM.<br/>
    For more information:<br/>
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm/run-command?view=azure-cli-latest#az-vm-run-command-invoke<br/>

The [az vm run-command invoke](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm/run-command?view=azure-cli-latest#az-vm-run-command-invoke) executes a specific command on a VM.
You need to pass the resource group, VM name, command ID (required), and the command. Arguments to the command can be passed via `--parameters` switch.
One potentially interesting detail from the VM is that there's a user named "jinglebells".
    
![runcmd](../img/objectives/o5/runcmd.jpg)
    
!!! success "Answer"
    az vm run-command invoke --resource-group northpole-rg2 --name NP-VM1 --command-id RunShellScript --scripts "ls"

## Response
!!! quote "Sparkle Redberry @ Rudolph's Rest Resort"
    Wow, you did it!
    It makes quite a bit more sense to me now. Thank you so much!<br/>
    That Azure Function App [URL](https://northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net/api/create-cert?code=candy-cane-twirl) you came across in the terminal looked interesting.<br/>
    It might be part of that new project Alabaster has been working on with the help of ChatNPT.<br/>
    Let me tell you, since he started using ChatNPT he's been introducing a lot of amazing innovation across the islands.<br/>
    Knowing Alabaster, he'll be delighted to tell you all about it! I think I last saw him on Pixel island.<br/>
    By the way, as part of the Azure documentation he sent the elves, Alabaster also noted that if Azure CLI tools aren't available in an Azure VM we should use the [Azure REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token) instead.<br/>
    I'm not really sure what that means, but I guess I know what I'll be studying up on next.<br/>
    Next up we need to pay a visit to Ginger Breddie in Santa's Shack...<br/>
    
Sparkle Redberry shared some interesting insights - Alabaster is working on the function app running in this Azure environment and should Azure CLI not be available, 
it's possible to use REST API instead. Good to know...
