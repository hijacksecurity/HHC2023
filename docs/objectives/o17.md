    Hey there, stranger! Fancy a game of cards? Luck's on your side today, I can feel it.<br/>
    Step right up, test your wit! These cards could be your ticket to fortune.<br/>
    Trust me, I've got a good eye for winners, and you've got the look of luck about you.<br/>
    Plus, I'd wager you've never played this game before, as this isn't any ordinary deck of cards. It's made with [Python](https://www.tenable.com/blog/python-nan-injection).<br/>
    The name of the game is to bamboozle the dealer.<br/>
    So whad'ya think? Are you clever enough?
    

## Hints
??? tip "The Upper Hand"
    <i>From: Shifty McShuffles<br/>
    Terminal: Na'an</i><br/>
    Shifty said his deck of cards is made with Python. Surely there's a [weakness](https://www.tenable.com/blog/python-nan-injection) to give you the upper hand in his game.

??? tip "Stump the Chump"
    <i>From: Shifty McShuffles<br/>
    Terminal: Na'an</i><br/>
    Try to outsmart Shifty by sending him an error he may not understand.
