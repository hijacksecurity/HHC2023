Imagine Santa traded his sleigh for a cybersecurity keyboard and elves started coding instead of making toys. Yep, that's the vibe!</p> <p>This annual bash, courtesy of the brainy folks at SANS Institute, is like a holiday party for hackers. But instead of sharing eggnog recipes, we're diving deep into festive-themed puzzles that would make even Rudolph scratch his antlers in confusion.</p> <p>In this report, we're spilling the digital cocoa on what went down. Expect tales of epic hacks, brain-teasing challenges, and maybe a reindeer or two trying to figure out a firewall. It's all fun, games, and a sprinkle of tech magic.</p> <p>So, buckle up, grab your elf hat (or your favorite tech gadget), and let's unwrap the adventures of the 2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge! \ud83c\udf85\ud83d\udd12\ud83c\udf89</p> <p>Wow ChatGPT sure is pretty good at writing report intros! \ud83d\ude0a A little bit of personal touch about this year's challenge. My name is HijackSecurity, it's my 2nd year fully completing Holiday Hack Challenge and writing the report. Hats off to SANS team, thank you - you guys did an amazing job creating this challenge, HHC seems to somehow only keep getting better and better!</p> <p>This year's game was awesome - fun, challenging and highly rewarding! The challenges had it all - AI, healthy amount of Azure APIs, SQL injections,  lots of client-side code manipulation (JS breakpoints - what are those), some GameBoy hacking, lock-picking went back to high-school days, JWT's are cool, practical Java Deserialization exploitation,  casual quick &amp; dirty Python scripting, satellite hacking and the need to think outside the box like every hacking challenge demands.</p> <p>Please give this write-up a read - you can follow along through all the objectives. Use \"Navigation tip\" to easily walk through challenges step-by-step. Each Section has a set of Objectives which contain what the Objective is, Solution (including official Answer) and Response after completion, along with other supplemental information to stay true to the Holiday Hack story. </p> <p>100-page submission limit</p> <p>Each year there's a huge number of write-ups that need to be reviewed by the Counter Hack team. To find a good middle ground between preventing information overload and creating a write-up that can stand on its own as a learning resource, some parts, like the navigation tip below, are collapsed by default. Skipping over these will not take away from understanding the overall solution, but feel free to expand them to get some additional information.</p> Navigation tip <p>Even with less than 100 pages, there's still quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use P or , to go to the previous section, N or . to navigate to the next section, and S, F, or / to open up the search dialog.</p> <p>TL;DR if you keep pressing N or . from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! </p>"},{"location":"#answers","title":"Answers","text":"<p>1.

My sticky number is 28.</p> <p>Step 2: Finding the guess numbers These 2 numbers lie between 0 and 11. Apply heavy tension (red) and start turning, one number at time, from 0 to 11.

This one is called Christmas Island. Nooo ho ho, not that Christmas Island. After countless years of shivering and shaking through each holiday season, I thought to myself, \"Why not trade the snowflakes for sunbeams, just once?\" Oh, the North Pole has its charm, but the bones do yearn for a bit of warmth now and then. The notion was suggested by my good friend, Chat North Pole Technology, or as we like to call it, 'ChatNPT'. That's the one we use, but there's a whole slew of other AI platforms. You should try them out! It came to me describing palm trees and gentle waves, saying, \"Santa, let your holidays take flight to Geese Islands, where the warmth isn't just a setting.\" \"There, every day is a sunny scene straight out of a vintage film reel.\" I chuckled at the thought, my belly shaking like a bowl full of jelly. But the AI persisted, \"Winter's best kept secret: the balmy breezes of Geese Islands!\" And I must confess, the sound of that did stroke my beard with curiosity. So, I called a meeting with the elves, the reindeer, and Mrs. Claus, of course.The elves were all a-buzz with the idea of crafting toys with a view of the ocean! Thus, we packed up our sleighs and ChatNPT charted a course for the Geese Islands, a tropical paradise just north of the equator.. And I must say, there's something quite magical about a Christmas carol sung to the strum of a ukulele. After all, the magic of the holidays isn't in the snow or the cold, but in the love and the care that we put into each and every gift. So here's to trying new things, to following the sunshine, and to the Geese Islands, where the holiday cheer is sun-kissed and the Christmas spirit is as warm as the tropical breeze. And it's all thanks to a little nudge from ChatNPT. Now, why not start off your vacation with a snowball fight with Morcel, or check out my surf shack on the other end of the beach?

Essentially, the goal of this set-up is instead of  importing each individual public key, the server can just trust any client logging in with their private key who's public key been signed by the trusted CA. In exchange, client can also trust the CA and the server connection will always be verified (no unknown host warning). Also, from the client's perspective, their public key would need to be signed by this trusted CA and then logging in is possible via this established trust. </p> <p></p> <p>From Alabaster, we know the user is <code>monitor</code> and target server is <code>ssh-server-vm.santaworkshopgeeseislands.org</code>. We also have the Request SSH Certificate function app served from  their Azure environment.</p> <p>Let's create an SSH key pair using <code>ssh-keygen</code>:</p> <p></p> <p>Copy-paste the public key in the function app. This will sign the key using the CA (this is app's functionality) and ultimately will allow SSH.</p> <p></p> <p>Now save the cert returned from the app. Its validity can also be verified using <code>ssh-keygen</code>. This confirms what we would expect - it is an SSH user certificate, it's signed by principal <code>elf</code> and allows PTY access.</p> <p></p> <p>At this point, we can SSH in, providing the private key and the certificate. This command really freaks you out the first time you run it.

In addition to the KringleCon talk, ChatGPT can be a good source to get more information about these principals. We know that <code>monitor</code> account was signed by \"elf\" principal so we can assume that \"admin\" is used for <code>alabaster</code>.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Let's get admin principal to provide us the certificate. This can be done by that Azure REST API elfs mentioned because this machine is in their Azure environment. Specifically, Alabaster mentioned the get-source-control Azure REST API, which works on https://management.azure.com resource. This domain requires an authorization token but since the VM is joined to the Azure environment, it should be possible to get this token using Azure Managed Identity. This can be found by looking through Azure documentation or simply asking ChatGPT.</p> <p></p> <p>The IMDS is Azure Instance Metadata Service and it does provide us the authorization token, just like AI suggested.</p> <p></p> <p>This access token can now be used within the get-source-control Azure REST API call to get the source control configuration of the function app. For convenience, you can store this large token in a file for <code>curl</code>, just don't forget to properly format it:</p> <p></p> <p>To build the URL, we need <code>subscriptionId</code>, <code>resourceGroupName</code> and app's <code>name</code> - we have this information from all the recon we did at Azure 101 objective. \ud83d\ude09 Now make the REST API request and learn where source code is stored:</p> <p></p> <p>At the GitHub repo, take a look at function app's source code.

Again, using the same JS console, check the speed variable and sure enough, it can be conveniently accessed. You can see the current value of <code>-500</code>. Now just change it to <code>-100</code> or even <code>-50</code> for much slower elfs.</p> <p></p> <p>The JS variable change takes immediate effect. Now the game is a piece of cake and 75 elfs can be easily hunted down!</p> <p>Answer</p> <p>speed to -50 #FTW </p> <p>Oh and what is this - Captain's Journal?!? </p>"},{"location":"objectives/o7/#response","title":"Response","text":"<p>Piney Sappington  @ Rainraster Cliffs</p> <p>Well done!

Nice to meet you! Oh golly! It looks like Alabaster deployed some vulnerable Azure Function App Code he got from ChatNPT. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for testing new technologies. The problem is that Alabaster didn't review the generated code and used the Geese Islands Azure production environment for his testing. I'm worried because our Active Directory server is hosted there and Wombley Cube's research department uses one of its fileshares to store their sensitive files. I'd love for you to help with auditing our Azure and Active Directory configuration and ensure there's no way to access the research department's data. Since you have access to Alabaster's SSH account that means you're already in the Azure environment.

The useful tools have got to be Impacket, which is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. They are handy for things like file shares and authentication attacks. </p> <p></p> <p>Almost all Impacket tools require the knowledge of target server or DC and for the most interesting things, valid credentials. At this point we don't have this information since even <code>alabaster</code> was logged in using only the key + cert. We need to continue to enumerate Azure environment to find more information. Let's again get an auth token. Properly output the authorization token into a file and confirm with a simple subscription request that everything is working correctly. Confirmed!</p> <p></p> <p>Now enumerate the Azure environment using REST API to look for something useful like values for Impacket. Let's list all the resources in a subscription. This shows us that there are 2 resources of type \"Microsoft.KeyVault\" - this should be interesting enough to dig a bit deeper. \ud83d\ude0a</p> <p></p> <p>More detailed information about KeyVaults can be retrieved like so. The most interesting  information here is vault URLs which are used for accessing secrets (as well as keys, certificates, and storage) within these vaults and they will be handy. Note how KeyVault URLs are at a different domains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you try to retrieve keys (or any other vault item) from the vaults, you will see the following error. This is because our OAuth access token audience is set for <code>https://management.azure.com/</code> and not <code>https://vault.azure.net</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>So, let's fix that - notice the Vault resource being requested (different OAuth audience):</p> <p></p> <p>Now we can try to get secrets. The important piece in value is the ID.</p> <p></p> <p>Using this ID, request this secret value. Bingo! This appears to be a PowerShell script for adding a user to the domain containing sensitive values.</p> <p></p> <p>Parse out the values and we have username, AD domain, password, and DC IP. These are the exact values we can take to Impacket.</p> <p></p> <p>Start up impacket and list users is a good next step - besides <code>elfy</code>, there's also <code>alabaster</code> and <code>wombleycube</code> (this should be useful later):</p> <p></p> <p>Looking around shares is another good enumeration step. This confirms that as user <code>elfy</code>, we do not have access to the <code>super_secret_research</code> folder which should contain the file we're looking for:</p> <p></p> <p>Taking into account \"Misconfiguration ADventures\" hint from Alabaster, we know that there might be a potential misconfiguration with AD certificates. Impacket's certipy should be good for finding these. Some general information about the CA can be gathered with its <code>find</code> command:</p> <p></p> <p>And a specific vulnerability found within one of the certificate templates:</p> <p></p> <p>With <code>certipy</code>, it is possible to abuse this vulnerability and request the certificate. As <code>elfy</code>, you can actually request authentication certificate for <code>womblecube</code>.  This will store the pfx certificate locally.</p> <p></p> <p>Now authenticate using <code>certipy</code> and the newly-requested certificate via Kerberos. The <code>auth</code> command will use either the PKINIT Kerberos extension or Schannel protocol for authentication with the provided certificate.  Kerberos can be used to retrieve a TGT and the NT hash for the target user, whereas Schannel will open a connection to LDAPS and drop into an interactive shell with limited LDAP commands.</p> <p></p> <p>Excellent, NTLM hash obtained!

I'm impressed! This is all starting to feel like more than just a coincidence though. Everything Alabaster's been setting up lately with the help of ChatNPT contains all these vulnerabilities. It almost feels deliberate, if you ask me. Now obviously an LLM AI like ChatNPT cannot have deliberate motivations itself. It's just a machine. But I wonder who could have built it and who is controlling it? On top of that, we apparently have a satellite ground station on Geese Islands. I wonder where that thing would even be located.

This is Captain's battlestation:</p> <p></p> <p>First, the background. We have the newly installed 'Just Watch This' Software Defined Radio system and are looking for the miscreants 'go-time' date and time for the attack so we could send a misleading message for  4 hours prior, and this will make sure islands' authorities are locked &amp; loaded for response. There are different ROLEs that are required for AUTHORIZATION to different items in Captain's Comms.</p> <p></p> <p>Let's look at the Owner's Card - from this we can gather that we should look for <code>rMonitor.tok</code> file containing the <code>radioMonitor</code> token which is somewhere in the default <code>/jwtDefault</code> directory. The proper use of this AUTHORIZATION token will allow viewing signals but not decode them. To decode, we would need <code>radioDecoder</code> role token. Sounds like <code>radioMonitor</code> is the initial role we should focus on obtaining. Cool, onto finding more about getting to this file.</p> <p></p> <p>Quickly check our current role. Copy the <code>justWatchThisRole</code> cookie value for <code>https://captainscomms.com</code> site (using Dev Tools) and decode the value using JWT.io. Good to know - our current role is <code>radioUser</code>. Also, keep in mind that the message is signed by <code>RS256</code> so you can't simply modify its contents, you would need the key to re-sign the payload.</p> <p></p> <p>Ok now let's refer to the Owner's Manual Volume 1. This confirms that we are on the lowest permissions role (<code>radioUser</code>) as well as we need to look for <code>radioMonitor</code> mentioned on the Owner's Card.</p> <p></p> <p>Let's try to get the <code>radioMonitor</code> role token based on all this information. From the Owner's Card, location should be <code>https://captainscomms.com/jwtDefault/rMonitor.tok</code>. On first access to this location, error \"Invalid authorization token provided\" occurs. Ok, let's observe normal traffic using Burp while interacting with Captain's Comms.  The request shows that we are actually authenticating with the token via Authorization header on each request. The rest of Captain's Comms requests likely require this header and that's why there was an error.</p> <p></p> <p>Re-send the request for <code>https://captainscomms.com/jwtDefault/rMonitor.tok</code> with our current Authorization header and value:</p> <p></p> <p>The token is returned and it can be confirmed. We can now access the <code>radioMonitor</code> required for Captain's SDR.</p> <p></p> <p>You can either use Burp to intercept the request to the SDR and replace Authorization header or simply copy-paste the new token value into <code>justWatchThis</code> cookie value. The second way is more convenient.</p> <p></p> <p>SDR is now accessible but not not very useful without the <code>radioDecoder</code> role.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Let's target obtaining <code>radioDecoder</code> token now. This token is not far away and after some tinkering, it can be found the same way as <code>radioMonitor</code>, by simply accessing <code>https://captainscomms.com/jwtDefault/rDecoder.tok</code> with the <code>radioMonitor</code> token in the Authorization header. Got it and confirmed:</p> <p></p> <p>Again, copy-paste the token into <code>justWatchThis</code> cookie and access the SDR - all 3 transmissions can now be decoded! Transmission 1 tells you that Captain's private key is in a folder called <code>TH3CAPSPR1V4T3F0LD3R</code>. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f</p> <p></p> <p>Transmission 2 gives us some kind of encoded message - we can investigate this further later.</p> <p></p> <p>Transmission 3 provides the frequency <code>10426 Hz</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>OK now we need to focus on obtaining the final JWT Radio Administrator privileges needed for the Captain's Transmitter because it's inaccessible with current privileges.</p> <p></p> <p>Reading through Captain's To-Do List, he seems to have used their less-than-convincing ChatNPT to store JWT private and public keys. We also have that journal from Chimney Scissorsticks (Comms Journal hint). Captain's Journal mentions another role <code>GeeseIslandsSuperChiefCommunicationsOfficer</code> which is likely the final JWT Radio Administrator role we need.</p> <p></p> <p>Now let's review Captain's ChatNPT Initial To-Do List since it was crossed off from Captain's To-Do List. This is interesting because we know exactly where this \"same directory\" is, so looking for <code>capsPubKey.key</code> file in <code>keys</code> folder should be no problem.</p> <p></p> <p>Make the request to <code>https://captainscomms.com/jwtDefault/keys/capsPubKey.key</code> with <code>radioDecoder</code> token and Captain's public key is retrieved.</p> <p></p> <p>Fix up the formatting a bit (no empty spaces) and <code>capsPubKey.key</code> is good to go:</p> <p></p> <p>Going back to Owner's Manual Volume II - it stresses the need to protect KEYs in FOLDERs. This feels like another hint, we need to go after finding Captain's private key, especially now that we know the folder name. </p> <p>At this point we should be able to find Captain's private key. We know all his keys are in <code>keys</code> folder and specifically he mentioned that we would never be able to find the private key folder but we did find it to be <code>TH3CAPSPR1V4T3F0LD3R</code> via Transmission 1. Based on Chimney Scissorsticks' hint that went something like \"I hear the Captain likes to abbreviate words in his filenames\", combine this with confirmed known public key name, we can make an educated guess that private key is called something like <code>capsPrivKey.key</code>.  Let's make the Burp request (again using our <code>radioDecoder</code> token) to <code>https://captainscomms.com/jwtDefault/keys/TH3CAPSPR1V4T3F0LD3R/capsPrivKey.key</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Private key secured! Just a bit of formatting to remove empty spaces, and <code>capsPrivKey.key</code> is ready to be used.</p> <p></p> <p>Now we need to create a JWT token that would give us <code>GeeseIslandsSuperChiefCommunicationsOfficer</code> role and sign it using Captain's private key. Let's start with <code>radioDecoder</code> token, Base64 decode it, modify the value and sign the JWT. All this can be easily done on JWT.io - modify the role, paste public and private keys, and confirm signature is verified since both keys are present.</p> <p></p> <p>Again, change the <code>justWatchThis</code> cookie to the new admin value (JWT token from JWT.io) and access Captain's Transmitter.</p> <p></p> <p>We know the frequency from Transmission 3 and now just need to decode message in Transmission 2 for date and time. Let's refer to Just Watch This Appendix A - it points to the Lincolnshire Poacher Number Station. </p> <p></p> <p>Based on Lincolnshire Poacher Number Station format, we can strip metadata and determine that actual message is \"12249 12249 16009 16009 12249 12249 16009 16009\". Now we need to decode it - we can use DCODE to try to find the most fitting cipher.  After trying out a few different ciphers, I found that to decipher it, DCODE's Octal converter can be used:</p> <p></p> <p>Now the final step is to send misleading transmission. Since decoded date and time is 12/24 16:00, we need to send it for 4 hours earlier, so 12:00.</p> <p></p> <p>Answer</p> <p>Frequency: 10426 HZ Go-Date: 1224 Go-Time: 1200 </p>"},{"location":"objectives/o9/#response","title":"Response","text":"<p>Chimney Scissorsticks @ Brass Bouy Port</p> <p>Brilliant work!
