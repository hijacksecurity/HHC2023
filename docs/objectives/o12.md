    I can't believe I was actually able to find this underground cavern!<br/>
    I discovered what looked liike an old pirate map in the attic of one of those huts in Rainraster Cliffs, and it actually led somewhere!<br/>
    But now that I've seen where it leads, I think this might've been a bad idea. This place is scary! Maybe you want to take it from here?<br/>
    I'm sure that cartridge is right nearby. Start walking around!<br/>
    Once you run into it, check back with me and I'll tell you what I know about winning.<br/>
    Good luck!<br/>
    Whoa, you found it!<br/>
    What version is it?<br/>
    Did you know that many games had multiple versions released? Word is: volume 2 has 2 versions!<br/>

    Try poking around Pixel Island. There really aren't many places you can go here, so try stepping everywhere and see what you get!

    1) This feels the same, but different! 2) If it feels like you are going crazy, you probably are! Or maybe, just maybe, you've not yet figured out where the hidden ROM is hiding. 3) I think I may need to get a DIFFerent perspective. 4) I wonder if someone can give me a few pointers to swap.
