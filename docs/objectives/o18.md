    Greetings, fellow adventurer! Welcome to Scaredy-Kite Heights, the trailhead of the trek through the mountains on the way to the wonderful Squarewheel Yard!<br/>
    I'm Eve Snowshoes, resident tech hobbyist, and I hear Alabaster is in quite the predicament.<br/>
    Our dear Alabaster forgot his password. He's been racking his jingle bells of memory with no luck.<br/>
    I've been trying to handle this password recovery thing parallel to this hashcat business myself but it seems like I am missing some tricks.<br/>
    So, what do you say, chief, ready to get your hands on some hashcat action and help a distraught elf out?<br/>
