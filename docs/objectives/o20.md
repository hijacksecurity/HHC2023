??? quote "Goose of Space Island @ Spaceport Point"

??? quote "Jewel Loggins @ Spaceport Point"
    What, you know the passphrase!? Let me try it!<br/>
    Nope, didn't work. Knowing Wombley, the passphrase isn't the only requirement. He's all about that MFA!<br/>
    Oh yeah, multi-factor authentication! The passphrase for something he knows, and his voice for something he is!<br/>
    That's it! You need to be Wombley. You need his voice. Now, how are you gonna get that?<br/>
    Since only us elves can get a subscription to use ChatNPT, try searching for another AI tool that can simulate voices. I'm sure there's one out there.


## Hints
??? tip "MFA: Something You Are"
    <i>From: Jewel Loggins<br/>
    Terminal: Space Island Access Speaker</i><br/>
    It seems the Access Speaker is programmed to only accept Wombley's voice. Maybe you could get a sample of his voice and use an AI tool to simulate Wombley speaking the passphrase.



## Solution
The challenge is to say the right phrase into the speaker as Wombley - this is his MFA to open the door.
![Speaker](../img/objectives/o20/speaker.jpg){ width="600" }

We actually know the phrase to enter the Satellite Ground Station (SGS) from beating [Active Directory](../objectives/o8.md).
Ok now we need Wombley's voice - let's go talk to him.

    Wombley Cube here, welcome to Chiaroscuro City!<br/>
    Have you heard about my latest project?<br/>
    I've been so inspired by these wonderful islands I've decided to write a short story!<br/>
    The title? It's "The Enchanted Voyage of Santa and his Elves to the Geese Islands." Sounds exciting, right?<br/>
    Here, have this [audiobook](https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2023/wombleycube_the_enchanted_voyage.mp3.zip) copy and enjoy the adventure at your convenience, my friend!<br/>
    Consider it a welcome gift from yours truly, to make your holiday even more delightful.<br/>
    Trust me, this captivating tale of fiction is going to take you on a magical journey you won't forget.<br/>
    Oh, and I promise it will provide some great entertainment while you explore the rest of Geese Islands!<br/>


Wombley gives us his audiobook - let's use some AI magic to copy his voice.
Use [PlayHT](https://play.ht/) service to generate his voice - upload `wombleycube_the_enchanted_voyage.wav` file and have the engine say the access phrase:

![Access Phrase](../img/objectives/o20/accessphrase.jpg)

Download the generated file and take it to the speaker. And just like that door is opened!


!!! success "Answer"
    And he whispered, 'Now I shall be out of sight;<br/>
    So through the valley and over the height.'<br/>
    And he'll silently take his way.<br/>

## Response
!!! quote "Jingle Ringford  @ Spaceport Point"
    Are you like a master spy or something? I've only seen stuff like that in the movies!<br/>
    It sure is scary what you can do with AI, huh? I sure hope ChatNPT has better guardrails in place.
    
You should definitely not use this trick to prank your friends and family.
