    Hey there, I'm Garland Candlesticks! I could really use your help with something.<br/>
    You see, I have this important pamphlet in my luggage, but I just can't remember the combination to open it!<br/>
    Chris Elgee gave a talk recently that might help me with this problem. Did you attend that?<br/>
    I seem to recall Chris mentioning a technique to figure out the combinations...<br/>
    I have faith in you! We'll get that luggage open in no time.<br/>
    This pamphlet is crucial for me, so I can't thank you enough for your assistance.<br/>
    Once we retrieve it, I promise to treat you to a frosty snack on me!<br/>

## Hints
??? tip "Lock Talk"
    <i>From: Garland Candlesticks<br/>
    Terminal: Luggage Lock Decode</i><br/>
    Check out Chris Elgee's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycM1hBSEyog) regarding his and his wife's luggage. Sounds weird but interesting!


## Solution
Let's attend [KringleCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycM1hBSEyog) for this challenge.
The way to get this lock opened is to put some (not too much) pressure on the lock (click 2-3 times), spin one dial until it get stuck,
then move one to the next dial until that one get stuck. When all 4 dials are stuck, press the rest of the way on the lock and it should open.
That's all there's to it!
