    Greetings, fellow adventurer! Welcome to Scaredy-Kite Heights, the trailhead of the trek through the mountains on the way to the wonderful Squarewheel Yard!<br/>
    I'm Eve Snowshoes, resident tech hobbyist, and I hear Alabaster is in quite the predicament.<br/>
    Our dear Alabaster forgot his password. He's been racking his jingle bells of memory with no luck.<br/>
    I've been trying to handle this password recovery thing parallel to this hashcat business myself but it seems like I am missing some tricks.<br/>
    So, what do you say, chief, ready to get your hands on some hashcat action and help a distraught elf out?<br/>


## Solution
??? abstract "HELP"
    In a realm of bytes and digital cheer,<br/> 
    The festive season brings a challenge near.<br/>
    Santa's code has twists that may enthrall,<br/>
    It's up to you to decode them all.<br/><br/>
    Hidden deep in the snow is a kerberos token,<br/>
    Its type and form, in whispers, spoken.<br/>
    From reindeers' leaps to the elfish toast,<br/>
    Might the secret be in an ASREP roast?<br/><br/>
    `hashcat`, your reindeer, so spry and true,<br/>
    Will leap through hashes, bringing answers to you.<br/>
    But heed this advice to temper your pace,<br/>
    `-w 1 -u 1 --kernel-accel 1 --kernel-loops 1`, just in case.<br/><br/>
    For within this quest, speed isn't the key,<br/>
    Patience and thought will set the answers free.<br/>
    So include these flags, let your command be slow,<br/>
    And watch as the right solutions begin to show.<br/><br/>
    For hints on the hash, when you feel quite adrift,<br/>
    This festive link, your spirits, will lift:<br/>
    [https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes)<br/><br/>
    And when in doubt of `hashcat`'s might,<br/>
    The CLI docs will guide you right:<br/>
    [https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hashcat](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hashcat)<br/><br/>
    Once you've cracked it, with joy and glee so raw,<br/>
    Run `/bin/runtoanswer`, without a flaw.<br/>
    Submit the password for Alabaster Snowball,<br/>
    Only then can you claim the prize, the best of all.<br/><br/>
    So light up your terminal, with commands so grand,<br/>
    Crack the code, with `hashcat` in hand!<br/>
    Merry Cracking to each, by the pixelated moon's light,<br/>
    May your hashes be merry, and your codes so right!<br/><br/>
    * Determine the hash type in hash.txt and perform a wordlist cracking attempt to find which password is correct and submit it to /bin/runtoanswer .*


This objective needs us to crack the Kerberos hash using `hashcat`. First check out the hash - the important part here is that
it's `$krb5asrep$` which is "Kerberos 5, etype 23, AS-REP" hash type [to be exact](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes).

![The Hash](../img/objectives/o18/hash.jpg)

We also have the password file that contains 143 entries.

![Password List](../img/objectives/o18/passwordlist.jpg)

Run the command: `hashcat -a 0 -m 18200 ./hash.txt ./password_list.txt -w 1 -u 1 --kernel-accel 1 --kernel-loops 1 --force` and it's cracked!

Let's breakdown the command:<br/>
`-a 0` is attack mode "straight", meaning dictionary-based<br/>
`-m 18200` specifies the hash type (Kerberos 5, etype 23, AS-REP)<br/>
`./hash` first positional parameter is the hash<br/>
`./password_list.txt` second is the password list<br/>
`-w 1` specifies the workload profile (low performance with minimal desktop impact)<br/>
`-u 1` is for manual workload tuning, setting innerloop step size to 1<br/>
`--kernel-accel 1` is for manual workload tuning, setting outerloop step size to 1<br/>
`--kernel-loops 1` is for manual workload tuning, setting innerloop step size to 1(same as `-u`)<br/>
`--force` is to ignore warnings<br/>

Now submit the answer and win!
