    Just my luck, I thought...<br/>
    A cybersecurity incident right in the middle of this stakeout.<br/>
    Seems we have a flood of unusual emails coming in through ChatNPT.<br/>
    Got a nagging suspicion it isn't catching all the fishy ones.<br/>
    You're our phishing specialist right? Could use your expertise in looking through the output of ChatNPT.<br/>
    Not suggesting a full-blown forensic analysis, just mark the ones screaming digital fraud.<br/>
    We're looking at all this raw data, but sometimes, it takes a keen human eye to separate the chaff, doesn't it?<br/>
    I need to get more powdered sugar for my donuts, so do ping me when you have something concrete on this.


## Hints
??? tip "DMARC, DKIM, and SPF, oh my!"
    <i>From: Fitzy Shortstack<br/>
    Terminal: Phish Detection</i><br/>
    Discover the essentials of email security with DMARC, DKIM, and SPF at [Cloudflare's Guide](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/).


## Solution
The goal of this mission is to make sure all phishing emails are identified correctly. Good start is to read up on [DMARC, DKIM and SPF](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/).
![Rules](../img/objectives/o15/rules.jpg)

First, check your DNS records:
![DNS](../img/objectives/o15/dns.jpg)

Now, go through emails looking for phishing discrepancies. Here are all the phishing ones.

First one is an obvious DMARC failure.<br/>
![1](../img/objectives/o15/1.jpg)

Second failed both DKIM and DMARC.<br/>
![2](../img/objectives/o15/2.jpg)

Third altered DKIM signature and failed DMARC.<br/>
![3](../img/objectives/o15/3.jpg)

Fourth was sent from a different domain but made appear to be from `@geeseislands.com` sender - typical spoofing attack.<br/>
![4](../img/objectives/o15/4.jpg)

Fifth is phishing for the same reason as fourth.<br/>
![5](../img/objectives/o15/5.jpg)

Sixth is missing DKIM signature and failed DMARC.<br/>
![6](../img/objectives/o15/6.jpg)

Seventh is sending email from different domain but email's "From" field says `@geeseislands.com` - definite phishing.<br/>
![7](../img/objectives/o15/7.jpg)

Eight has invalid DKIM and failed DMARC.<br/>
![8](../img/objectives/o15/8.jpg)

Ninth is trying to spoof `@geeseislands.com` user - not on my watch lol.<br/>
![9](../img/objectives/o15/9.jpg)

Tenth is same as ninth - spoofing attempt. If it was legit, "From" email field would reflect same value as Return-Path along with correct sending domain.<br/>
![10](../img/objectives/o15/10.jpg)


!!! success "Answer"
    All phishing emails were found by a human.<br/>
    ![10](../img/objectives/o15/win.jpg)
