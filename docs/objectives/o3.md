    Hey, welcome to Santa's Surf Shack on tropical Christmas Island! I'm just hanging ten here, taking it easy while brushing up on my Linux skills.<br/>
    You ever tried getting into Linux? It's a super cool way to play around with computers.<br/>
    Can you believe ChatNPT suggested this trip to the Geese Islands this year? I'm so thrilled!<br/>
    Kudos to ChatNPT, eh? The sunshine, the waves, and my surfboard ‚Äì simply loving it!<br/>
    So, what do you have planned? Care to join me in a Linux session?<br/>
    
    
## Solution

??? abstract "Welcome message"
    The North Pole üéÅ Present Maker:<br/>
    All the presents on this system have been stolen by trolls. Capture trolls by following instructions here and üéÅ's will appear in the green bar below. Run the command "hintme" to receive a hint.
    

### Question 1
!!! question "Question"
    Perform a directory listing of your home directory to find a troll and retrieve a present!
    
To list directories in Linux, it's simply `ls`.

![ls](../img/objectives/o3/ls.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    ls


### Question 2
!!! question "Question"
    Now find the troll inside the troll.
    
To find the troll, simply read the troll file with `cat`.

![cat](../img/objectives/o3/cat.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    cat troll_19315479765589239
    

### Question 3
!!! question "Question"
    Great, now remove the troll in your home directory.
    
To remove file, run `rm` on it.

![rm](../img/objectives/o3/rm.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    rm troll_19315479765589239
    

### Question 4
!!! question "Question"
    Print the present working directory using a command.
    
To get the current working directory, run `pwd`.

![pwd](../img/objectives/o3/pwd.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    pwd

### Question 5
!!! question "Question"
    Good job but it looks like another troll hid itself in your home directory. Find the hidden troll!

To list hidden files/folders, use `ls -a` which will list ALL files/folders. `-l` switch makes it look nicer but not required.

![lsla](../img/objectives/o3/lsla.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    ls -a


### Question 6
!!! question "Question"
    Excellent, now find the troll in your command history.
    
Run `history` to get history of commands and pipe its output to input of `grep` which will search for `-i` (case-insensitive) word `troll`.
    
![history](../img/objectives/o3/history.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    history | grep -i troll
    

### Question 7
!!! question "Question"
    Find the troll in your environment variables.
    
 Command `env` outputs all environment variables for the current user - pipe its output to grep to find the troll.
 
![env](../img/objectives/o3/env.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    env | grep -i troll
    

### Question 8
!!! question "Question"
    Next, head into the workshop.

Simply `cd` to change directory

![cd](../img/objectives/o3/cd.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    cd workshop


### Question 9
!!! question "Question"
    A troll is hiding in one of the workshop toolboxes. Use "grep" while ignoring case to find which toolbox the troll is in.

Run `grep -i troll *` to read all files in current directory, searching for the case-insensitive word troll.

![grep](../img/objectives/o3/grep.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    grep -i troll *

### Question 10
!!! question "Question"
    A troll is blocking the present_engine from starting. Run the present_engine binary to retrieve this troll.

First, we need to find the present_engine file using `find / -name present_engine 2>/dev/null` which looks for all files with this name while dropping all error messages for cleaner output (stderr in this case is lack of permissions for some files/directories).
Once the file is found in the current directory, it cannot be ran (permission denied) - this is due to missing execution bit.
Set the execution bit using `chmod +x` and rerun the file FTW.

![present_engine](../img/objectives/o3/present_engine.jpg)
    
!!! success "Answer"
    find / -name present_engine 2>/dev/null<br/>
    chmod +x /home/elf/workshop/present_engine<br/>
    /home/elf/workshop/present_engine<br/>


### Question 11
!!! question "Question"
    Trolls have blown the fuses in /home/elf/workshop/electrical. cd into electrical and rename blown_fuse0 to fuse0.

To rename files, use `mv` .

![mv](../img/objectives/o3/mv.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    cd /home/elf/workshop/electrical<br/>
    mv blown_fuse0 fuse0<br/>



### Question 12
!!! question "Question"
    Now, make a symbolic link (symlink) named fuse1 that points to fuse0

Use `ln -s` to create a symbolic link - source filename is first while destination is next.

![ln](../img/objectives/o3/ln.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    ln -s fuse0 fuse1


### Question 13
!!! question "Question"
    Make a copy of fuse1 named fuse2.

To copy, use `cp`.

![cp](../img/objectives/o3/cp.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    cp fuse1 fuse2


### Question 14
!!! question "Question"
    We need to make sure trolls don't come back. Add the characters "TROLL_REPELLENT" into the file fuse2.

Use `echo` to output text, appending (`>>`) it to the file.
    
![echo](../img/objectives/o3/echo.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    echo "TROLL_REPELLENT" >> fuse2
    

### Question 15
!!! question "Question"
    Find the troll somewhere in /opt/troll_den.

Since challenge mentions "somewhere," we can use case-insensitive `-iname` switch for the `find` command, as well as wildcards (*) to include filenames that contain troll in their filename.
    
![find_somewhere](../img/objectives/o3/find_somewhere.jpg) 
    
!!! success "Answer"
    find /opt/troll_den -iname *troll*


### Question 16
!!! question "Question"
    Find the file somewhere in /opt/troll_den that is owned by the user troll.
    
To find file base on owner, use `-user` switch.

![find_owner](../img/objectives/o3/find_owner.jpg)    

!!! success "Answer"
    find /opt/troll_den -user troll 2>/dev/null
    
    
### Question 17
!!! question "Question"
    Find the file created by trolls that is greater than 108 kilobytes and less than 110 kilobytes located somewhere in /opt/troll_den.

Find a file (`-type f`) that is over 108KB (`-size +108l`) but less than 110KB (`-size -110k`).

![find_w_size](../img/objectives/o3/find_w_size.jpg)
    
!!! success "Answer"
    find /opt/troll_den -type f -size +108k -size -110k
    
    
### Question 18
!!! question "Question"
    List running processes to find another troll.
    
`top` can be used to monitor running processes.

![top](../img/objectives/o3/top.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    top
    

### Question 19
!!! question "Question"
    The 14516_troll process is listening on a TCP port. Use a command to have the only listening port display to the screen.

To get listening processes use `netstat` with `-ntlp` switches to not resolve names, TCP-only, listening, and programs/PID respectfully.

![netstat](../img/objectives/o3/netstat.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    netstat -ntlp

    
### Question 20
!!! question "Question"
    The service listening on port 54321 is an HTTP server. Interact with this server to retrieve the last troll.

Since this is an HTTP server, `curl` can be used to make a basic request to the localhost on specified port.

![curl](../img/objectives/o3/curl.jpg)
    
!!! success "Answer"
    curl http://127.0.0.1:54321
    

### Question 21
!!! question "Question"
    Your final task is to stop the 14516_troll process to collect the remaining presents.

To list all running processes, `ps -aux` can be used and from there, use `kill` to kill the process PID in question.

![kill](../img/objectives/o3/kill.jpg)

!!! success "Answer"
    kill 28128
