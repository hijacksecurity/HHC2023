    The name's Angel Candysalt, the great treasure hunter!<br/>
    A euphemism? No, why do people always ask me that??<br/>
    Anyways, I came here to nab the treasure hidden in this ship graveyard, only to discover it's protected by this rusted maze.<br/>
    That must be why all these old ships are here. Their crew came to find the treasure, only to get lost in the labrynth.

    There are 3 buried treasures in total, each in its own uncharted area around Geese Islands.<br/>
    I've been getting lost in this maze for hours now with no luck, and my feet are starting to get sore.<br/>
    Maybe you'll be able to find the way through. Here, use my Gameboy Cartridge Detector. Go into your items and test it to make sure it's still working.<br/>
    When you get close to the treasure, it'll start sounding off. The closer you get, the louder the sound.<br/>
    No need to activate or fiddle with it. It just works!<br/>
    At least it's obvious where this one is. See that shiny spot over to the right? That's gotta be where it is! If only I had a bird's eye view.<br/>
    But how to get there? Up? Down? Left? Right? Oh well, that's your problem now!<br/>
    Come back if you can find your way to it, and I'll tell you some secrets I've heard about this one.<br/>


## Hints

    1) This one is a bit long, it never hurts to save your progress! 2) 8bit systems have much smaller registers than you’re used to. 3) Isn’t this great?!? The coins are OVERFLOWing in their abundance.
