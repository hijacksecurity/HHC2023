    There are 3 buried treasures in total, each in its own uncharted area around Geese Islands.<br/>
    I've been getting lost in this maze for hours now with no luck, and my feet are starting to get sore.<br/>
    Maybe you'll be able to find the way through. Here, use my Gameboy Cartridge Detector. Go into your items and test it to make sure it's still working.<br/>
    When you get close to the treasure, it'll start sounding off. The closer you get, the louder the sound.<br/>
    No need to activate or fiddle with it. It just works!<br/>
    At least it's obvious where this one is. See that shiny spot over to the right? That's gotta be where it is! If only I had a bird's eye view.<br/>
    But how to get there? Up? Down? Left? Right? Oh well, that's your problem now!<br/>
    Come back if you can find your way to it, and I'll tell you some secrets I've heard about this one.<br/>

??? quote "Dusty Giftwrap @ Tarnished Trove"
    Arrr, matey, shiver me timbers! There be buried treasure herrrrre.<br/>
    Just kidding, I'm not really a pirate, I was just hoping it would make finding the treasure easier.<br/>
    I guess you heard about the fabled buried treasure, too? I didn't expect to see anyone else here. This uncharted islet was hard to find.<br/>
    I bet one of these creepy toys has the treasure, and I'm sure not going anywhere near them!<br/>
    If you find the treasure, come back and show me, and I'll tell you what I was able to research about it.<br/>
    Good luck!

??? quote "Dusty Giftwrap @ Tarnished Trove"
    Whoa, you found it!<br/>
    It's a... video game cartridge? Coooooollll... I mean, arrrrrr....<br/>
    So, here's what my research uncovered. Not sure what it all means, maybe you can make sense of it.<br/>
    You have all three? I think that makes you ruler of the pirates!


## Hints

    Objective: Game Cartridges: Vol 1</i><br/>
    Listen for the gameboy cartridge detector's proximity sound that activates when near buried treasure. It may be worth checking around the strange toys in the Tarnished Trove.

    Objective: Game Cartridges: Vol 1</i><br/>
    1) Giving things a little push never hurts. 2) Out of sight but not out of ear-shot 3) You think you fixed the QR code? Did you scan it and see where it leads?

The Game Boy Cartridge Detector comes in handy for finding games:

## Solution
This challenge starts off a 3-part series of GameBoy hacking. After playing the game once normally, the goal is clear - you need to put together a QR code
by moving individual blocks into their designated locations one by one. There are a couple of hints along the way.
One mentions the game looking disastrously bad:

![Looks Bad](../img/objectives/o11/lookbad.jpg){ width="600" }

And the other one said something along the lines of "if I find the developer who skipped out on assets for this game!" ðŸ˜‚

![Missing Assets](../img/objectives/o11/assets.jpg){ width="600" }

Thanks for the observations, let's see the source code using Chrome Dev Tools.
The most interesting file relevant to the game is script.js which contains game assignments.

![Script](../img/objectives/o11/script.jpg){ width="600" }

Some of the most interesting assignments are found here - undocumented game keys which will be useful.
The palette can be changed with "]" and "[" as well as backspace can be used to rewind. This is very helpful considering
that you need to move 7 blocks to correct positions and you can normally only move blocks forward and if you mess up, you 
have to start over.

![Undocumented Keys](../img/objectives/o11/undockeys.jpg){ width="600" }

The different palette is also super helpful - you can find one that automatically shows movable blocks without playing music.

![New Palette](../img/objectives/o11/palette.jpg){ width="600" }

Ok now that game dynamics are improved, all 7 blocks just have to be move to their spots.
Once they are all in place, scan the QR code, which leads to [website with the flag](https://8bitelf.com/).
