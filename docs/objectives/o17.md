    Hey there, stranger! Fancy a game of cards? Luck's on your side today, I can feel it.<br/>
    Step right up, test your wit! These cards could be your ticket to fortune.<br/>
    Trust me, I've got a good eye for winners, and you've got the look of luck about you.<br/>
    Plus, I'd wager you've never played this game before, as this isn't any ordinary deck of cards. It's made with [Python](https://www.tenable.com/blog/python-nan-injection).<br/>
    The name of the game is to bamboozle the dealer.<br/>
    So whad'ya think? Are you clever enough?
    

## Hints
??? tip "The Upper Hand"
    <i>From: Shifty McShuffles<br/>
    Terminal: Na'an</i><br/>
    Shifty said his deck of cards is made with Python. Surely there's a [weakness](https://www.tenwable.com/blog/python-nan-injection) to give you the upper hand in his game.

??? tip "Stump the Chump"
    <i>From: Shifty McShuffles<br/>
    Terminal: Na'an</i><br/>
    Try to outsmart Shifty by sending him an error he may not understand.



## Solution
To start solving this challenge, let's read up on [Python NaN Injection](https://www.tenable.com/blog/python-nan-injection) from Shifty's hint.
One of the most importants parts in the article is this:
!!! note
    A variable can be injected with a string called NaN (which stands for Not a Number) and when it encounters another variable, it can consume it. For instance, a numeric integer like the number 1 can be added to a float that contains a NaN and the output will be a NaN. NaN then becomes extremely greedy.

Now the card game itself - we need to beat Shifty at his Card Shuffle game, who's a habitual cheater. 
Ok we can cheat too to even the playing field. ðŸ˜‰

![Rules](../img/objectives/o17/rules.jpg)

First play the game normally to observe functionality and (obviously) lost the first hand.

![Lose](../img/objectives/o17/lose.jpg)

Everything is pointing towards us needing to exploit this Python's NaN vulnerability. Let's start looking through game's code.
Set breakpoint at the `reset_cards` function call (line 789).
You can walk through some of this initial `cardArray` assignments using F9 - Step in the debugger.
The most interesting assignments are these `cardArray`'s `.cardtext.setText('-')` obviously setting the values back to null.

![Breakpoint](../img/objectives/o17/breakpoint.jpg)

Let's resume execution to let the game reset values. Ok now just set your card numbers 1 - 5 and drop into JS console.
Make sure Console's context is set to `nannannannannannan.com` websit and check both `cardArray`s to see which one is yours - this clearly show that ours is `cardArray2`.

![cardArray2](../img/objectives/o17/array2.jpg)

Now we can loop through our array setting all values to string 'NaN' to confuse backend Python application.
Create a simple loop in JS console for setting all card values in our array to 'NaN', then confirm they are set.

![cardArray2](../img/objectives/o17/loops.jpg)

Play your cards and sure enough we win 2 points.

![Play](../img/objectives/o17/play.jpg)

Follow the same process setting all our card values to 'NaN' until we reach 10 points and game won!



!!! success "Answer"
    ```javascript linenums="1" title="loop.js"
    for (let i = 0; i < cardArray2.length; i++) {
        cardArray2[i].cardtext.setText('NaN');
    }
    ```
    
## Response
!!! quote "Shifty McShuffles @ Chiaroscuro City"
    Well, you sure are more clever than most of the tourists that show up here.<br/>
    I couldn't swindle ya, but don't go telling everyone how you beat me!<br/>
    An elf's gotta put food on the table somehow, and I'm doing the best I can with what I got.<br/>
    

Sounds like Shifty has been running his "Card Shuffle" operation on tourists for a while. ðŸ˜‚
